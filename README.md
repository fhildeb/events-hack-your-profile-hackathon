# Join the LUKSO "Hack your Profile" Hackathon, November 3rd-29th

Welcome to the first ever LUKSO Hackathon!
We have the basics ready and invite you to hack your profile!
LUKSO is a new EVM Blockchain launching in the coming months. But its more than that, it comes with the core standards that enable a new creative economy.

The core pieces of LUKSO are Universal Profiles based on [ERC725 Account (LSP0)](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-0-ERC725Account.md) and [LSP6 Key Manager](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-6-KeyManager.md), as well as a [Universal Receiver Delegate](https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-1-UniversalReceiver.md#specification-of-the-universalreceiverdelegate).
[You can read more about these pieces here](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/introduction).

LUKSO focuses on bringing Blockchain to the masses through its next level EVM based blockchain running the Casper FFG pure Proof of Stake consensus, new smart contract standards and tools to make developing for the new creative economy user-friendly and fun._

The LUKSO "Hack your Profile" Hackathon is the first-ever LUKSO hackathon!

This is an online hackathon which will allow developers to build something amazing around [Universal Profiles](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/Universal-Profiles). You can join solo or create a team of up to 5 members.

## Key Dates

**Submission Deadline**: November 29th at 5pm CET

Use the LUKSO [L14 Test Network](https://docs.lukso.tech/networks/l14-testnet)

Build something that uses or is built on top of one or multiple [Universal Profiles](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/Universal-Profiles). You can use the [new token standards](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/NFT2.0), as they are fully interoperable with Universal Profiles.

You are encouraged to use the following libraries: [lsp-factory.js](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/lsp-factoryjs/getting-started), [erc725.js](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/erc725js/getting-started) and the [relayer API](https://docs.lukso.tech/tools/relayer-api/execute-transaction) (if you want to hide transaction fees from your users).
